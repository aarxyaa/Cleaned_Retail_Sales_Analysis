## Data Cleaning Summary

This dataset was cleaned and pre-processed to make it suitable for analysis. The following steps were taken:

1. Renamed the column `quantiy` to `quantity` to fix a typo.
2. Converted `sale_date` from string to datetime format.
3. Converted `sale_time` from string to time format.
4. Removed any duplicate rows.
5. Handled missing values using **forward fill** for:
   - `age`
   - `quantity`
   - `price_per_unit`
   - `cogs`
   - `total_sale`
6. Exported the cleaned dataset as `Cleaned_Retail_Sales_Analysis.csv`.

This cleaning ensures consistent data types, no nulls, and no duplicate entries for smooth analysis.
